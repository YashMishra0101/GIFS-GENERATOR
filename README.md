This project is a practice project created for learning purposes, with a primary focus on React. It uses HTML, Tailwind CSS, React, React Router, and Axios for API handling. The project consists of two main pages: one for generating random GIFs and another for creating custom GIFs based on user input

The project features two main pages:

1. **Random GIF Generator:** This page displays a random GIF fetched from an external API. It demonstrates making an API call and rendering the result.

2. **Custom GIF Generator:** On this page, users can input a custom keyword, and the application fetches a GIF related to the keyword from the API. It showcases interaction with user input and dynamic rendering based on user choices.
